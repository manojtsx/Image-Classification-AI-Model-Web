# Teachable Machine Object Recognition Model

## Overview
This repository contains an image classification model trained using Google's Teachable Machine platform. The model is hosted on Google servers and is capable of recognizing various objects including Human, Human hand, ceiling, plug, slipper, and spectacle. The model can be integrated into websites for efficient image classification.

## Model Details
- **Framework:** TensorFlow.js
- **Model Hosting:** Google servers
- **Classes Recognized:**
  1. Human
  2. Human hand
  3. Ceiling
  4. Plug
  5. Slipper
  6. Spectacle

## Usage
### Website Integration
To integrate the model into a website, follow these steps:

1. Include the TensorFlow.js library in your HTML file:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs"></script>
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow-models/mobilenet"></script>
   ```

2. Load the Teachable Machine model:
   ```html
   <script type="text/javascript">
     async function loadModel() {
       const modelURL = 'https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/<YOUR_MODEL_ID>/model.json';
       const metadataURL = 'https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/<YOUR_MODEL_ID>/metadata.json';
       const model = await tmImage.load(modelURL, metadataURL);
       return model;
     }
   </script>
   ```

3. Use the model for image classification:
   ```html
   <script type="text/javascript">
     async function classifyImage(imageElement) {
       const model = await loadModel();
       const prediction = await model.predict(imageElement);
       // Handle prediction results
       console.log(prediction);
     }
   </script>
   ```

4. Provide a user interface for users to upload images and display the results.
